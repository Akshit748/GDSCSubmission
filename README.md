# GDSCSubmission
This is my submission for the Google Student Developer Club

NOTE: This was created by me and 2 other people back in grade 12, the project file pdf has a comprehensive list of features,functioning and various things used, it also has screenshots of the inputs and outputs so you dont have to do go through the pain of doing it yourself :) 
TLDR; Please go through the pdf for a better understanding 

if you do want to run the program yourself, you might need to remove the section of the code which talks about a loading screen (i wasnt able to recover the source code for that, but it exists and screenshots of the same are mentioned in the pdf)
